# sum numbers from 0 to n

suppose n is 700
0+100 100+55
155+x
x is any number
0+x=y
0+x=y+any number repeat until you arrive at n
when x is y repeat until you arrive at n
when x=5 repeat by adding consecutively
0+x=5 add repeat and store result
5+1 repeat sum plus 1 until n

# see if word has more than one "r"

start by r=1
in a word consider r=1
in a word detect r and add to find number of r's
if y=r and r=1 then y=1
find y
retain
if you find another y
add to previous y
retain sum
until solution
ie number of r 's in a word
